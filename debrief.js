<p> Thank you for participating in this study </p>
<p>We are aiming to identify under what conditions people answer mathematical judgement questions linearly (i.e. as expected) or non-linearly. </p> 
<p>You either answered number line questions or Likert scale questions first. This was with the aim of seeing whether individuals answer more linearly when asked to complete number line questions first, acting as a priming effect on judgements.</p>
<p>You may have noticed you were asked to complete questions of differing lengths, this was also to test if there are differences in linearity of answers according to scale length (5, 7 or 9 point).  </p>
<p>The final difference in questions was that some were phrased positively i.e. Lilyann likes something 3x more, and others phrased negatively i.e. Ines likes something 1x less. This again is to identify which scenarios experience the most linear answers to Likert scale questions. </p>
<p>As stated in the consent form, please contact Alex Doumas, Lilyann Richardson or Ines Costa E Sousa if you have any questions. </p>
